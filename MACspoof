#sudo required for permissions-just authenticate machine and remember the rules
#eth0 is the name of the interface we want to change the MAC address for
sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether '00:11:22:33:44:55'
#make sure you run sudo for each line
#here hw stands for hardware interface and '00:11:22:33:44:55' is the fake MAC that is given to change the MAC--STEP2
#remember to use ' and not ` for this command.  The above will be the new MAC address and should appear after ifconfig command when finished.
sudo ifconfig eth0 up
#this reenables the interface--STEP3
